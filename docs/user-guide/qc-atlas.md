# QC Atlas User Guide

[QC Atlas](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/qc-atlas) is a platform for sharing quantum software as part of the [Quantum Application Lifecycle Management (QuAntiL)](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL) and the project [PlanQK](https://planqk.de/en/).
It enables the collection of information about quantum algorithms, available implementations, and publications.
Also the collection of information about available software platforms, cloud services, and their offered compute resources, such as quantum computers and simulators, are enabled.
