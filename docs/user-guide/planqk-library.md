# PlanQK Library

The [PlanQK Library](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/PlanQK-Library) is a REST API to use [JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref) as a service in order to collect, organize and discover literature.
It allows users to create libraries where they can add, update and delete literature entries.
Literature entries are in the BibTeX format.
Moreover, a user can conduct systematic literature reviews.
