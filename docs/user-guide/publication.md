Clicking on the ``Plus Button`` will open the following dialog.
In the dialog, it is possible to give the new publication a title and assign multiple authors to it. A new author will be added by using the ``Add Author Button`` on the right side. An existing author will be removed using the ``Delete Author Button``.

!!! note 
    To create a new publication a ``title`` and at least one ``author`` is required.

After all necessary fields have been filled in, the creation of the publication can be confirmed by clicking on the ``OK Button``. After a successful creation, the user will be navigated to the ``Publication View`` of the new publication.

## Delete Publication

!!! info 
    To perform the deletion of a publication, the user has to be in the ``Publication List View``.

To remove a specific publication, the user has to simply click on the ``Delete Button`` in the ``Actions Column`` of the data table.

The user can also remove multiple publications at once by selecting them using the check-boxes of the data table. After the user has made his selection he can press the ``Master Delete Button`` at the top of the data table.

!!! note 
    The ``Master Delete Button`` will only appear after at least one publication is selected.

To confirm the deletion of the selected publication(s), the user has to click on the ``YES Button`` of the ``Confirmation Dialog``.

!!! note 
    **Titles** of publications that will be deleted are displayed in the body of the dialog and should be checked before confirming the deletion.

## Update Publication Information

!!! info 
    To update the information of a publication, the user has to be in the ``Publication View`` which can be reached by clicking on a publication in the ``Publication List View``.

Updating basic information is done in the ``General Tab`` of the ``Publication View``. To do that, the user has to simply use the ``Input fields``, ``Check-Boxes`` or ``Selection drop-downs`` to add new values or adjust existing ones.

If information is changed, a ``Save Button`` will be displayed next that specific input field. Also, a ``Master Save Button`` will appear at the right side of the screen. To save the changes of each input field individually, the user can click on the ``Save Button`` next to any updated input field. Alternatively the user can save all changes by clicking the ``Master Save Button``.

!!! note 
    The user can also hit ``Enter`` on the keyboard to save the changes of a single field in most cases. In some cases, it may be necessary to focus the ``Save Button`` by hitting ``TAB`` on the keyboard and then confirming with ``Enter``.

## Reference Algorithms

!!! info
    To reference algorithms in an existing publication, the user has to be in the ``Publication View``.

In the ``Publication View`` of the publication, the user as to switch to the ``Algorithms Tab``, which is dedicated to referencing algorithms.
To link algorithms with the currently selected publication, the user has to click on the ``Plus Button`` at the top of the data table.

This will open a dialog with a separate data list of existing algorithms.
For referencing publications the user can now search the table and click on the ``Link Button`` of the algorithm he wants to reference.

![alt text](./images/publication/Link_Algorithm_-_Step_2.1.png "Link single algorithm")

Alternatively, the user can use the check-boxes to select multiple algorithms he wants to reference. 
After at least one algorithm is selected, a ``Master Link Button`` will appear at the top of the table which can be used to link all selected algorithms with the publication.

## Dereference Algorithms

!!! info 
    To dereference algorithms, the user has to be in the ``Algorithms Tab`` of the ``Publication View``, which can be reached by clicking on an implementation in the ``Implementation List View``.
	
To remove a reference to a algorithm, the user has to simply click on the ``Delete Button`` of a algorithm in the ``Actions Column``.

![alt text](./../images/publication/Unlink_Algorithm_-_Step_1.1.png "Dereference single algorithm")

Alternatively, use the check-boxes to select multiple algorithms and then click on the ``Master Delete Button`` to unlink all of them at once.

!!! note 
    The ``Master Delete Button`` will only appear if at least one algorithm is selected.

## Reference Implementations

!!! info
    Implementations can not be referenced from within the ``Publication View``.
    To reference implementations in an existing publication, the user has to navigate to the ``Publications Tab`` of the ``Implementation View`` of an algorithm.

## Dereference Implementations

!!! info 
    To dereference implementations, the user has to be in the ``Implementations Tab`` of the ``Publication View``, which can be reached by clicking on an implementation in the ``Implementation List View``.
	
To remove a reference to a implementation, the user has to simply click on the ``Delete Button`` of an implementation in the ``Actions Column``.

![alt text](./../images/implementation/Unlink_Publication_-_Step_1.1.png "Dereference single implementation")

Alternatively, use the check-boxes to select multiple implementations and then click on the ``Master Delete Button`` to unlink all of them at once.

!!! note 
    The ``Master Delete Button`` will only appear if at least one implementation is selected.
