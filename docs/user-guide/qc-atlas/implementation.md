## Implementation 
### Create Implementation

!!! info 
    To create an implementation, the user has to be in the ``Algorithm View`` of a specific algorithm.

In the ``Algorithm View`` the user has to click on the ``Implementation Tab``, which opens the ``Implementation List View``.
This view contains all implementations of that algorithm. Within this view, a new implementation will be created via the ``Plus Button`` which is located above the list.

Clicking on the ``Plus Button`` will open the following dialog.
In the dialog it is possible to give the new implementation a name.

!!! note 
    To create a new implementation only a ``name`` is required.

![alt text](/user-guide/images/implementation/Create_Implementation_-_Step_2.png "Fill input")

After all necessary fields have been filled in, the creation of the implementation can be confirmed by clicking on the ``OK Button``. After a successful creation, the user will be navigated to the ``Implementation View`` of the new implementation.

### Delete Implementation

!!! info 
    To delete an implementation, the user has to be in the ``Implementation Tab`` of the ``Algorithm View`` of a specific algorithm.

To delete a specific implementation, the user has to simply click on the ``Delete Button`` in the ``Action Column`` of the data table.

![alt text](/user-guide/images/implementation/Delete_Implementation_-_Step_1.png "Delete single implementation")

It is also possible to delete multiple implementations at once by selecting them one by one using the check-boxes within the table. When at least one implementation is selected, a ``Master Delete Button`` will show up above the table. To delete the selected implementations at once, this button must be pressed.

![alt text](/user-guide/images/implementation/Delete_Implementation_-_Step_2.png "Delete multiple implementation")

Both ways of deleting implementations will lead to a confirmation dialog. This dialog will list all implementations that were selected to be deleted. To finally confirm the deletion, the ``OK Button`` at the bottom of the dialog has to be pressed. A successfully deleted implementation will disappear from the ``Implementation List View``.

### Update Implementation Information

!!! info 
    To update the information of a implementation, the user has to be in the ``Implementation View``.

Updating basic information is done in the ``General Tab`` of the ``Implementation View``. To do that, the user has to simply use the ``Input fields``, ``Check-Boxes`` or ``Selection Drop-Downs`` to add new values or adjust existing ones.

![alt text](/user-guide/images/implementation/Update_Implementation_Properties_-_Step_1.png "'General Tab' of the 'Implementation View'")

If information is changed, a ``Save Button`` will be displayed next that specific input field. Also, a ``Master Save Button`` will appear at the right side of the screen. To save the changes of each input field individually, the user can click on the ``Save Button`` next to any updated input field. Alternatively the user can save all changes by clicking the ``Master Save Button``.

!!! note 
    The user can also hit ``Enter`` on the keyboard to save the changes of a single field in most cases. In some cases, it may be necessary to focus the ``Save Button`` by hitting ``TAB`` on the keyboard and then confirming with ``Enter``.
