Within the ``Creation Dialog``, the user will have to enter all important information of the software platform he wants to create.

!!! note 
    Currently the only required information is the **name** of the software platform.

### Delete Software Platform

!!! info 
    To perform the deletion of a software platform, the user has to be in the ``Software Platform List View``.
	
To remove a specific software platform, the user has to simply click on the ``Delete Button`` in the ``Actions Column`` of the data table.

The user can also remove multiple software platforms at once by selecting them using the check-boxes of the data table. After the user has made his selection he can press the ``Master Delete Button`` at the top of the data table.

!!! note 
    The delete button will only appear after at least one software platform has been selected by the user.

To confirm the deletion of the selected software platform(s), the user has to click on the ``YES Button`` of the ``Confirmation Dialog``.

!!! note 
    **Names** of the software platforms that will be deleted are displayed in the body of the dialog and should be checked before confirming the deletion.

### Update Software Platform Information

!!! info 
    To update the basic information of a software platform, the user has to be in the ``Software Platform View`` which can be reached by clicking on a software platform in the ``Software Platform List View``.
	
Updating basic software platform information is done in the ``General Tab`` of the ``Software Platform View``. To update a property, the user has to simply use the ``Input Fields``, ``Check-Boxes`` or ``Selection Drop-Downs`` to add new property values or adjust existing ones.

![alt text](./../images/software_platform/Update_Software_Platform_-_Step_1.PNG "General Tab of Software Platform View")

If a value of a property is changed, a ``Save Button`` will be displayed next that specific input field. Also, a ``Master Save Button`` will appear at the right side of the screen. To save the changes of each input field individually, the user can click on the ``Save Button`` next to any updated input field. Alternatively the user can save all changes by clicking the ``Master Save Button``.

!!! note 
    * The user can also hit ``Enter`` on the keyboard to save the changes of a single field in most cases. In some cases, it may be necessary to focus the ``Save Button`` by hitting ``TAB`` on the keyboard and then confirming with ``Enter``.
    * Some fields are links to other sites. Those can easily be detected by their ``Open Button``. On click or on ``Enter``, it will open the link in a new tab.
