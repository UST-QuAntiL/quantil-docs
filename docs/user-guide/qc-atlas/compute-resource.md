## Compute Resource 
### Create Compute Resource

To create a compute resource the user has to navigate to the ``Execution Environment List View`` by using the navigation sidebar.

While in the ``Execution Environment List View``, the navigation sidebar will display sub menus for different kinds of execution environments. To create a compute resource, the user has to navigate to the ``Compute Resource List View``.

![alt text](/user-guide/images/compute_resource/Create_Compute_Resource_-_Step_2.PNG "Navigate to compute resource list view")

Inside the ``Compute Resource List View``, the user can click on the ``Plus Button`` to initiate the creation of a new compute resource inside a separate ``Creation Dialog``.

![alt text](/user-guide/images/compute_resource/Create_Compute_Resource_-_Step_3.PNG "Open creation dialog")

Within the ``Creation Dialog``, the user will have to enter all important information of the compute resource he wants to create.

!!! note 
    Currently the only required information is the **name** of the compute resource.

After entering the name of the compute resource, the user has to confirm the creation by clicking on the ``OK Button``.

### Delete Compute Resource

!!! info 
    To perform the deletion of a compute resource, the user has to be in the ``Compute Resource List View``.
	
To remove a specific compute resource, the user has to simply click on the ``Delete Button`` in the ``Actions Column`` of the data table.

![alt text](/user-guide/images/compute_resource/Delete_Compute_Resource_-_Step_1.1.PNG "Delete single resource")

The user can also remove multiple compute resources at once by selecting them using the check-boxes of the data table. After the user has made his selection he can press the ``Master Delete Button`` at the top of the data table.

!!! note 
    The ``Master Delete Button`` will only appear if at least one compute resource is selected.

![alt text](/user-guide/images/compute_resource/Delete_Compute_Resource_-_Step_1.2.PNG "Delete multiple resources")

To confirm the deletion of the selected compute resource(s), the user has to click on the ``YES Button`` of the ``Confirmation Dialog``.

!!! note 
    **Names** of the compute resources that will be deleted are displayed in the body of the dialog and should be checked before confirming the deletion.

### Update Compute Resource Information

!!! info 
    To update the information of a compute resource, the user has to be in the ``Compute Resource View`` which can be reached by clicking on a compute resource in the ``Compute Resource List View``.
	
Updating basic information is done in the ``General Tab`` of the ``Compute Resource View``. To do that, the user has to simply use the ``Input Fields``, ``Check-Boxes`` or ``Selection Drop-Downs`` to add new values or adjust existing ones.

![alt text](/user-guide/images/compute_resource/Update_Compute_Resource_-_Step_1.PNG "General Tab of Compute Resource View")

If information is changed, a ``Save Button`` will be displayed next that specific input field. Also, a ``Master Save Button`` will appear at the right side of the screen. To save the changes of each input field individually, the user can click on the ``Save Button`` next to any updated input field. Alternatively the user can save all changes by clicking the ``Master Save Button``.

!!! note 
    The user can also hit ``Enter`` on the keyboard to save the changes of a single field in most cases. In some cases, it may be necessary to focus the ``Save Button`` by hitting ``TAB`` on the keyboard and then confirming with ``Enter``.
	
![alt text](/user-guide/images/compute_resource/Update_Compute_Resource_-_Step_2.PNG "Saving the changes")

!!! info 
	**Compute Resource Properties** of are stored separately and therefor do not belong to the basic information of a resource. They are saved, deleted or updated instantly without the use of the mentioned ``Save Buttons``.
	
### Create Compute Resource Property

!!! info 
    To create a property for a compute resource,  the user has to be in the ``Compute Resource View`` which can be reached by clicking on a compute resource in the ``Compute Resource List View``.
	
Creating properties for a compute resource is done in the ``General Tab`` of the ``Compute Resource View``. To do that, the user has to simply click on the ``Plus Button`` of the dedicated ``Compute Resource Property Field``.

![alt text](/user-guide/images/compute_resource/Add_Compute_Resource_Property_-_Step_1.PNG "Open Property Dialog")

This will open a separate ``Creation Dialog`` where the user will have to enter all important information of about the property he wants to create.

!!! note 
	The **Type Name** field supports auto-completion functionality. While typing a type name, the system will suggest existing types with that name in a drop-down. On click of an existing type, all necessary fields will be filled automatically.

![alt text](/user-guide/images/compute_resource/Add_Compute_Resource_Property_-_Step_2.PNG "Dialog structure")

After all fields have been filled, the user can finally add the property by confirming the creation via the existing ``OK Button``.

!!! note 
	The **Property Value** needs to match the selected **Data Type**.
	
![alt text](/user-guide/images/compute_resource/Add_Compute_Resource_Property_-_Step_3.PNG "Confirm creation")

After the property has been successfully created, it will appear in the the dedicated ``Compute Resource Property Field`` of the ``Compute Resource View``.
