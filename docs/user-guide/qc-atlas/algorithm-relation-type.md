## Algorithm Relation Type

### Create Algorithm Relation Type

!!! info 
    To create a algorithm relation type, the user has to be in the ``Algorithm Relation Type List View`` which can be found in the ``Manage Components Menu``.
	
Inside the ``Algorithm Relation Type List View``, the user can click on the ``Plus Button`` to initiate the creation of a new algorithm relation type inside a separate ``Creation Dialog``.

Within the ``Creation Dialog``, the user will have to enter all important information about the algorithm relation type he wants to create.

!!! note 
    Currently the only required information is the **name** of the algorithm relation type.

After entering the name of the algorithm relation type, the user has to confirm the creation by clicking on the ``OK Button``.

!!! info 
    In case of a successful creation, the data table will switch to the last page (if not already) to show the created algorithm relation type.
	
### Update Algorithm Relation Type

!!! info 
    To update a algorithm relation type, the user has to be in the ``Algorithm Relation Type List View``, which can be found in the ``Manage Components Menu``.
	
Inside the ``Algorithm Relation Type List View``, the user can choose a algorithm relation type he wants to update by clicking on it's ``Edit Button`` which can be found in the ``Actions Column`` of the data table.
This will open a ``Edit Dialog``.

Within the ``Update Dialog``, the user can adjust the information of the algorithm relation type.

!!! note 
    Currently the only required information is the **name** of the algorithm relation type.

### Delete Algorithm Relation Type

!!! info 
    To perform the deletion of a algorithm relation type, the user has to be in the ``Algorithm Relation Type List View``, which can be found in the ``Manage Components Menu``.
	
To delete a specific algorithm relation type, the user has to simply click on it's ``Delete Button`` in the ``Actions Column`` of the data table.

The user can also remove multiple algorithm relation types at once by selecting them using the check-boxes of the data table. After the user has made his selection he can press the ``Master Delete Button`` at the top of the data table.

!!! note 
    The ``Master Delete Button`` button will only appear if at least one algorithm relation type is selected.

To confirm the deletion of the selected algorithm relation type(s), the user has to click on the ``YES Button`` of the ``Confirmation Dialog``.

!!! note 
    **Names** of the algorithm relation type(s) that will be deleted are displayed in the body of the dialog and should be checked before confirming the deletion.
